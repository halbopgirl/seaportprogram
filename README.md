This project simulates the inner workings of a seaport. 
1. Cargo and passenger ships enter and leave the port.
2. The people in the port are qualified to do different jobs, but can only execute one job at a time.
3. Ships have jobs that need to be completed before they can leave the port.

This application uses concurrent programming via thread pools and locks to demonstrate the execution of different jobs in the seaport, as well as ships entering and leaving the port.
